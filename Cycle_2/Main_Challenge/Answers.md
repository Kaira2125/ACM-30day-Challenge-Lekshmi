## **Which model you chose and why?**
I chose the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel because it works well with high-dimensional data like text. SWM is effective and performs well with TF-IDF features. It's also relatively fast and accurate for text classification tasks.
## **How TF-IDF helped capture important features?**
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) helped by giving more weight to words that are important and less common across tweets. 
## **Challenges faced and how you solved them**
Cleaning raw tweets was tricky due to URLs, mentions, emojis, and hashtags. I handled this with regex patterns and preprocessing functions.
I struggled with uploading the dataset due to its size. I solved this by manually uploading the dataset to Google Drive and mounting it in my notebook.
