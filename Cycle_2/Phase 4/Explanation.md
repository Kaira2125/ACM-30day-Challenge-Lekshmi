## **Why is Dimensionality Reduction Used?**
TF-IDF creates sparse, high-dimensional data. Reducing dimensions helps remove noise, improve performance, and makes patterns easier to detect.

## **What Does SVD/PCA Achieve?**
SVD/PCA compresses data into fewer dimensions while keeping important info. This makes it easier to visualize and work with the data.

## **How Does Clustering Help Without Labels?**
Clustering groups similar data points without needing labels. It helps reveal hidden patterns or topics in the dataset.
